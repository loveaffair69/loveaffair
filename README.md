## Organizational Structure Overview

Love Affair is a decentralized non-profit organization made up of peers. It is
organized as a series of autonomous sub-groups which directly interact with
each other and share information or provide service to other sub-groups for the
benefit of the organization as a whole. There is no single centralized
authority that makes decisions on behalf of all the parties. Each sub-group
makes decisions towards its individual goals.

Love Affair relies on the independent decision making power of its
(agents)[TODO] and sub-group.  

In keeping with our commitment to absolute transparency, all information
pertinent to Love Affair and its operations can be found in this GitHub
repository.
